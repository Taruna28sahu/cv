        <h2>Optimal Allocation of Distributed Generation Units Correlated by using Coyote Optimization Algorithm.</h2>
        <h4>2020-2021</h4>
        <p>A new optimizer,i.e.,<strong>Coyote Optimization Algorithm</strong> is developed to handle the optimal allocation of different types of DGs by minimizing the
power losses and reducing the fault currents in the network with economizing the installed FCLs sizes.</p>

        <h2>IOT Based AC Voltage Regulation along with Load Monitoring System</h2>
        <h4>2017-2018</h4>
        <p>Project is designed to control the voltage of single-phase supply, by using devices with <strong>internet
      connectivity</strong>. An automation system is used that can control intensity of bulb from a device with internet
      connectivity. Devices are connected to the microcontroller based switching circuit. The switching circuit
      has microcontroller coding to control the devices like fans, lights etc. The Arduino UNO is programmed
      using the microcontrollerâ€™s interactive <strong>embedded C language</strong>.</p>
